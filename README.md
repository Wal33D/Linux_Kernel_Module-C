# LinuxKernelModule

LinuxKernelModule is a custom Linux kernel module designed to demonstrate kernel programming concepts and provide a practical example of how to extend the Linux kernel's functionalities.

## Features

- **Custom System Calls**: Implements new system calls to perform specific kernel-level operations.
- **Character Device**: Includes a character device to allow user-space programs to communicate with the kernel module.
- **Proc File**: Uses a proc file for reading/writing data directly from/to the kernel space.
- **Kernel Threads**: Demonstrates the creation and management of kernel threads.
- **Synchronization Mechanisms**: Enforces synchronization using mutexes and spinlocks to protect shared resources.
- **Logging**: Utilizes the kernel's logging mechanism to print messages for debugging and monitoring module behavior.
- **Memory Management**: Implements examples of memory allocation and deallocation in the kernel space.
- **Module Parameters**: Uses module parameters to allow users to pass arguments to the kernel module during insertion.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Linux system with kernel headers installed
- GCC compiler
- Make

## Installation

To compile the LinuxKernelModule, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LinuxKernelModule.git
```

2. Navigate to the LinuxKernelModule directory:
```
cd LinuxKernelModule
```

3. Compile the module:
```
make
```

## Loading and Unloading the Module

To load the module into the kernel, use:
```
sudo insmod linux_kernel_module.ko
```

To check if the module was loaded successfully, use:
```
dmesg | tail
```

To unload the module from the kernel, use:
```
sudo rmmod linux_kernel_module
```

## Usage

After loading the module, you can interact with it through the proc file, character device, or by invoking the custom system calls (depending on your module's functionality).

For example, to read data from the proc file:
```
cat /proc/your_proc_file
```

To write data to the proc file:
```
echo "Hello, Kernel!" > /proc/your_proc_file
```
