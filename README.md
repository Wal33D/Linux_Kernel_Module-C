- **Step-by-Step Tutorials**: Detailed tutorials designed to simplify the kernel module development process, from setup to deployment.
- **Testing & Debugging Tools**: Discover tools and methodologies for effective testing and debugging of kernel modules, ensuring reliability and performance.
- **Community Contributions**: Engage with a community passionate about kernel development, sharing knowledge, and driving innovations.

## üõ† Getting Started

### Preparations

To begin your kernel module development journey, you'll need:
- A system running a Linux distribution.
- Knowledge of C programming language.
- Basic understanding of Linux kernel architecture and module development.
- The GCC compiler and Make for building modules.
- The Linux kernel headers installed on your system.

### Installation Steps

1. **Install Required Packages**:

   On Ubuntu/Debian-based systems:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install build-essential linux-headers-$(uname -r)
   ```

   On CentOS/RHEL-based systems:
   ```bash
   sudo yum install gcc make kernel-devel
   ```

2. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Wal33D/Linux_Kernel_Module-C.git
   cd Linux_Kernel_Module-C
   ```

3. **Compile Your Module**:
   Navigate to your module's directory and initiate the compilation:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

4. **Insert Your Module into the Kernel**:
   Load your module into the kernel environment:
   ```bash
   sudo insmod your_module_name.ko
   ```

### Usage Tips

After loading your module, inspect its output or interaction with the system using `dmesg`. To remove the module:
```bash
sudo rmmod your_module_name
```
