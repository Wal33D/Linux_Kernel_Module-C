## üõ† Getting Started

### Preparations

Embark on your kernel module development journey equipped with:
- A Linux-based operating system.
- A grasp of C programming.
- Familiarity with the Linux kernel and module development (a plus).
- GCC compiler and Make build automation tool.
- Linux kernel headers.

### Installation Steps

1. **Install Dependencies**:

   For Ubuntu/Debian systems:
   \`\`\`bash
   sudo apt-get install build-essential linux-headers-$(uname -r)
   \`\`\`

   For CentOS/RHEL systems:
   \`\`\`bash
   sudo yum install gcc make kernel-devel
   \`\`\`

2. **Clone the Repository**:
   \`\`\`bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/LinuxKernelModule.git
   cd LinuxKernelModule
   \`\`\`

3. **Build Your Module**:
   Jump into the module directory of your choice and fire up the build process:
   \`\`\`bash
   make
   \`\`\`

4. **Deploy Your Module**:
   Unleash your module into the kernel realm:
   \`\`\`bash
   sudo insmod your_module_name.ko
   \`\`\`

### Usage Tips

Deployed your module? Marvel at its prowess by checking the kernel log with \`dmesg\`. Need to retract your module? Simply:
\`\`\`bash
sudo rmmod your_module_name
\`\`\`
